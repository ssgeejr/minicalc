# MiniCalc

MiniCalc is a **super simple** command-line calculator built with Python.

Just pass in a math problem — MiniCalc will solve it.

## 🧠 What It Does

You give it any basic math expression (like `3 + 4 * 2`), and MiniCalc solves it using Python’s built-in math capabilities.

Examples:
```

\$ python minicalc.py "3 + 4 \* 2"
11

````

## ✅ Features

- Accepts any valid math expression
- Returns the correct result
- Simple, readable Python code
- No dependencies

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MiniCalc.git
   cd MiniCalc
````

2. Run the calculator:

   ```bash
   python minicalc.py "8 / 2 + 3"
   ```

## 📋 Roadmap

* [ ] Add error handling for invalid expressions
* [ ] Add unit tests
* [ ] Create a GUI version (maybe?)
